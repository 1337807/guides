# For Them

"For them": A (terrible++) pun on the word "forum".

This is an engine I'm building to investigate how engines in Rails 3 work. Many would call it a "proof of concept".

It has both RSpec tests and Cucumber features.

I'll be working on it over the coming weeks (I hear Railscamp is coming up!) and hopefully I'll be able to craft a nice chapter-sized guide on it to add to http://github.com/radar/guides and Rails 3 in Action.
